This blog is an experiment in many ways, that is, I have a variety of goals to accomplish through it. Here they are: 

1. Develop my thoughts in more detail for things I already understand
2. Enhance my knowledge of things I do not yet understand (like Jekyll and static-web programming, lol)
3. Work-out the kinks for my custom keyboard layout
4. Increase my github commit rate

The truth of the matter is, I haven't written _creatively_ in a very long time. All most everything I write now-a-days are 
standard operating procedures for refreshing dashboards or pulling data from various sources. I haven't had to _persuade_ anyone, 
of *anything*, in ages. And I can feel that I am starting to lose something...that _spark_ of something. And so I am going
to write about my thoughts and hopefully some neurons will reconnect in a familiar way again. 

The second purpose of this blog is to elucidate that which I am currently learning. There is so much I want to learn (or 
need to learn) and I simply must start being systematic about it all. This blog will help me organize my thoughts and help
me learn through developing explanations. 

The third purpose is to literally practice typing. I have one of those fancy, customizable keyboards and I may have made 
a rather dangerous layout. You see, I've mixed the shift key with the space key. A long press means shift and a short (regular) 
press makes a space. But what this means is that if I start typing quickly and I have to capitalize, I end up making an extra 
space instead of a capital letter. I mostly like the layout but maybe the shift key should be moved. Unless, I can practice
with it a bit more and make it work. 

Finally, using github to develop a blog means that I will increase my github commit rate. I would love to show multiple commits
per day to a prospective employer. Seems like a good goal to accomplish while tackling the other three. 

 thank (darn keyboard) you for reading!
