This blog is an experiment in many ways, that is, I have a variety of goals to accomplish through it. Here they are: 

1. Develop my thoughts in more detail for things I already understand
2. Enhance my knowledge of things I do not yet understand (like `Jekyll` and static-web programming, lol)
3. Work-out the kinks for my custom keyboard layout
4. Increase my github commit rate

The truth of the matter is, I haven't written _creatively_ in a very long time. All most everything I write nowadays is 
purely technical. I have not set my _thoughts_ down in ages. And I can feel that I am starting to lose something. Maybe it
is the remote work, or lingering effects from the pandemic, or possibly old age...but I feel that I have _lost_ some _spark_ 
of something. And so I am going to write about my thoughts and hopefully some neurons will reconnect in a familiar way again. 

The second purpose of this blog is to help me learn new things. I love the process of learning. But there is so much that 
I want to learn! This blog will help me organize my thoughts and help me learn through developing explanations. Hopefully 
you will learn something interesting, too!

The third purpose is a bit silly. I have one of those fancy, customizable keyboards and I somewhat regret the layout. 
You see, I've doubled-up the shift key and the space key. A long press means shift and a short (regular) 
press makes a space. But what this means is that if I start typing quickly and I have to capitalize, I end up making an extra 
space instead of a capital letter. Maybe a little more practice is all I need.

Finally, using `Github` to develop a blog means that I will increase my commit rate. I would love to show multiple commits
per day to a prospective employer. Seems like a good goal to accomplish while tackling the other three. 

Thank you for reading!
