I am my keyboard's slave...

My main keyboard for many years was a Microsoft Ergonomic 4000. I'm sure you are familiar with it. A large plastic frame, a bit of a "hump" in the middle that separates two sections of keys. A classic ergonomic keyboard. It served me well for many years until I noticed that some keys lost their action. I did a little bit of research and learned that this meant the entire keyboard was broken. Like many entry level keyboards, the Ergo 4000 uses a membrane with a raised "bubble" under each key. To fix a keyboard which operates from this mechanism, one would have to change the membrane for the entire keyboard. This sounded like a pain. Time to move on to a mechanical keyboard!

It turns out there are many kinds of mechanical keyboards. My immediate considerations were:

1. Layout
-  Conventional vs Split
2. Keyswitches
-  Brown / Blue / Red / any other color you can think of
3. Aesthetics
- How do you want your keyboard to look?

I decided to focus on the layout first and go with a split/ergonomic mechanical keyboard. This greatly lowered the number of keyboards that met my search criteria. The top 3 that caught my attention were:

1. The [Glove M80](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards/products/glove80-split-ergonomic-keyboard-revision-2?variant=47282998739217)
2. The [Advantage 360](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards/products/glove80-split-ergonomic-keyboard-revision-2?variant=47282998739217)
3. The [Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager/buy)

The _Glove M80_ seemed to be the most highly rated keyboard of the three. I read that users experienced a cessation of wrist pain after using the _Glove M80_. The drawback for me was that the keys were literally soldered to the board, meaning that the ability to change out individual keys-witches was lost. This was one of the primary reasons I wanted a mechanical keyboard.
The _Advantage 360_ also was highly reviewed. But it seems like a relic from 90s corporate culture. It's a massive brick! I just couldn't get excited about it. But then the _Voyager_ ...

... well, you can see by visiting the website that it has some **slick** marketing. The keyboard is split, the keys are re-programmable, and the key-switches can be replaced easily when they fail. I would have never dreamed in a million years that I would pay so much for a keyboard, but the _Voyager_ is what I chose. I chose the "Kailh Chocolate Brown" key-switches because they are the loudest keys I thought my spouse would tolerate (Hey, some people like loud cars, I like loud keyboards). And you can tell that the _Voyager_ is **beautiful**.  

I have owned the keyboard for a solid 9 months now, and I absolutely love it. The keyboard is a joy to use. The _Voyager_ not only has programmable keys but also programmable "layers". I can tap or hold a specific key and transform _every other key_ on the keyboard. This level of customization has been both freeing and confining. When I initially got my keyboard, I found that the default layer did not have a "delete" key mapped. So I couldn't login to my work Windows PC. I moved some keys around, and hilariously thought that doubling up "shift" and the "space" keys would be a good idea. I would tap to trigger "space" and then hold to trigger "shift". Ooo boy that was a mistake. So many sentences started with an extra space and no capital letter. I thought that I would eventually get the rhythm of it but after 8 months I just couldn't make it happen. I guess this is why I didn't progress in piano a kid. So here I am, re-mapping my keys to be more sensible.

Which brings me to the main drawback of this keyboard: I cannot use any other keyboard. I am used to having my hands 16" apart, my wrists angled, typing out spaces and activating layers without thinking. A normal keyboard is now confining and uncomfortable. I can never go back. This is the danger of a programmable, mechanical, ergonomic keyboard. You are trapped for life. 

But you should totally buy one!
