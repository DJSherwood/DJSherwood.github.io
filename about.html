# Background
My history in analytics is odd. In highschool, I enjoyed learning calculus and mathematics in general, but was not particularly drawn
to an engineering field. Finances were a bit tight so I ended up attending college at the _University of Texas at San Antonio_. It was mostly a commuter school at the time
(the parody motto was "_Come Here, Park Far!_" oh how true that was). Even so, I joined the Honors College and had the luck to become one of the few
recipients of the _Undergraduate Math & Biology_ Scholarship. It was funded by a grant won by Dr. David Senseman and Dr. James Bower.
The stipulation was to work in a lab as an undergraduate. I was happy to do so because it was definitely better than my previous job
as a cashier/checker at Target.

I ended up in Dr. Fidel Santamaria's lab, where I learned to use MATLAB to analyze simulated biochemical reactions. It was a fantastic
experience, and I am forever grateful to Dr. Santamaria for his mentorship.

I graduated in 2009 and briefly attended Rice University in their Biochemistry and Cell Biology PhD program. I should have taken a gap year or
chosen a different program; I burned out in the middle of the second semester. But I knew I wanted to work with math, so I simultaneously gained
an internship at a biomedical engineering firm and enrolled in UTSA's Master's program in Biomedical Engineering. I completed my Master's Thesis under
Dr. Matthew Reilly. Again, I am in debt to his mentorship and support.

After graduating I was able to find a job with the City of Austin as a statistician of sorts. It was there that I learned R, MicroStrategy, and some SQL.
In 2019 I moved back to San Antonio with my wife and I got a job as a financial analyst with KCI, a biomedical company that specialized in selling wound vac services.
They were bought by 3M in the fall of 2019. I retained my job through the beginning of the pandemic but was ultimately laid off in 2021.
I was then able to find work with Ernst and Young, as a Sr. Data Analyst. And that is where I am now!

# Current Interests
I enjoy using the bayesian approach to statistics. It feels very natural to define variables of interest with a prior distribution. I am convinced that ultimately,
a prior structure/set of assumptions must be adopted for an analysis to be of value. Thus, I am also very interested in causal inference.
I am not especially driven to learn AWS but the cloud seems to be the medium through which analytics are conducted so I guess I should learn that, too.
I very much would like to improve at trading options, so I am always on the lookout for new/better ways to forecast stock prices.
One day, I'll get around to learning Blender or maybe comfyUI and do something truly creative. Until then, I'll just be at my computer making graphs. :)
