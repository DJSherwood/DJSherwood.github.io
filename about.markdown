# Background
I feel that my career path has essentially been a randomwalk. I enjoyed studying calculus and science in High School, but 
I did not feel drawn to a specific major when enrolling at _The University of Texas at San Antonio_ in 2005.
I chose Biology as my major and decided to pursue mathematics as my minor (at the very least). In a remarkable twist of fate, 
my biology professor received a grant to establish a student scholarship program that encouraged Biology students to work in 
computational labs and mathematics students to work in biological labs as student researchers. This seemed like a perfect opportunity for me. The stipend wasn't quite
enough for me to live on my own, but by living at home I could pay for all of my university related costs. 

Dr. Fidel Sanatamaria agreed to let me join his lab in the fall of 2007. It turned out to be a fantastic learning experience for me. 
I am forever grateful for Dr. Santamaria's mentorship; I learned so much from him. It was there that I learned to use `MATLAB`, 
`MCell3`, `Linux`, create `bash` scripts and create parallel computing jobs on the _Texas Advanced Computing Center_'s (TACC) cluster.

But, due to my father's sudden passing in 2007, I found myself mentally and emotionally exhausted by the time I graduated in 2009. 
I enrolled in a PhD program at Rice University anyway, but only lasted a semester and-a-half. I pulled myself together and 
enrolled in a Master's for Biomedical Engineering at UTSA in 2011. Again, I was fantastically lucky in that I found a paid 
position to work in Dr. Matthew Reilly's lab. Dr. Reilly was also a fantastic mentor. It was there that I started learning
applied statistics.

After graduating I was able to find a job with the City of Austin as a "statistician." It was there that I learned `R`, `Python`, `Scikit-Learn`, and `SQL`.
In 2019 I moved back to San Antonio with my wife and I got a job as a financial analyst with *KCI*, a biomedical company that specialized in selling wound vac services.
They were bought by *3M* in the fall of 2019. It there that I learned to use `Tableau`. I retained my job through the beginning of the pandemic but was ultimately laid off in 2021.
I was then able to find work with *EY*, as a Sr. Data Analyst. And that is where I am now!

# Current Interests
I enjoy using the bayesian approach to statistics. It feels very natural to define variables of interest with a prior distribution. 
I am convinced that a prior structure/set of assumptions must be adopted for an analysis to be of value. Thus, I am also 
very interested in causal inference. I am learning to use AWS. I very much would like to improve at trading options, so I 
am always on the lookout for new/better ways to forecast stock prices. One day, I'll get around to learning Blender or 
maybe comfyUI and do something truly creative. Until then, I'll just continue my random-walk through life. :)
